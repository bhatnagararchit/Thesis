\section{Move to appendix: Cytoplasmic flows in WT} 

\subsection{Measuring cytoplasmic flows using \ac{piv}} %%TODO: CHECK PARAMETERS
Cytoplasmic flows in the embryos were measured using the \ac{bf} frames in the embryo movies (see \autoref{sec:imageAnalysis}). A MATLAB implementation of \ac{piv} \citep{thielicke2014pivlab} was used to calculate the flow fields in the cytoplasm from the \ac{bf} frames (see \autoref{subsec:corticalFlows} for general introduction to \ac{piv}), with the boundary segmentations (see \autoref{subsec:nucleusTracking}) used to exclude the exterior of the embryo. Yolk granules in the cytoplasm serve the role of the tracer particles in the cytoplasm. A multi-pass (4 passes) PIV was utilized, with initial template size of \SI{24}{\pixels} and step size of \SI{4}{\pixels}. Max displacement of each template during cross-correlation was limited to \SI{7}{\pixels}.
